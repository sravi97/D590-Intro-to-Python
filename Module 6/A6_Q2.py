#Question 2
#Write a function body_mass_index(height, weight) which receives height in 
#inches and weight in pounds, converts height to meters and weight to kilograms,
#then calculates and returns BMI.
#Function main() prompts for personâ€™s height in inches and weight in pounds, 
#calls body_mass_index(height, weight) to determine BMI and prints the BMI and
#a message telling whether the person is above, within or below the healthy 
#range.
#Function main() uses exception to check if the user enters a non-number. The 
#function prints an error message and quits if the user enters a non-number or
#a negative number.
